    "text": "Biketown is a bike share organisation that allows users to use their bikes. It also records data of how where and when these bikes were ridden.\nUsing this data to inform users of general trends will hopefully motivate them to ride bikes more often. Riding bikes has a two fold advantage: firstly people stay fit when they ride bike and secondly use of bikes will most probably reduce car usage and thus protect the environment.\n\nIn my blog, I have used the data about riders time, duration, location etc. to find out general trends that people can see and understand easily and use this to choose how they wish to ride."

    "text": "Analysis\n\nComparison of Speed.\nThe average speed of an average rider is 15 miles per hour. Nevertheless, speed varies on various factors such as inclination of the road, weather conditions, the type of bike, etc.\n\n\n\nSpeed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Speed of bikes in miles per hour\n\n\n\n\nIn the above Figure 1 we can see average speed of different bikes. The above figure is obtained by only using speed below 30 miles per hour to see speeds in the normal limits. We can observe that Betrue Max Lightbike has the highest median speed.\nBikes that have traveled over the speed of 30 miles per hour are AIR SAFARI, BIKETOWN, AIR TRAINER\n\n\nTop 5 bikes according to their average speed\nUsing all the data we have, from the Table 1 the bike with the highest average speed is BETRUE MAX LIGHTBIKE.\n\n\n\n\nTable 1:  Bikes that have travelled at very high speed \n \n  \n    bikeName \n    avg_speed \n  \n \n\n  \n    BETRUE MAX LIGHTBIKE \n    7.194210 \n  \n  \n    AIR SAFARI RECON \n    7.166667 \n  \n  \n    BIKETOWN LIGHTBIKE \n    6.731211 \n  \n  \n    BIKETOWN \n    6.581878 \n  \n  \n    AIR TRAINER \n    6.033198 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTime of Day\nDifferent people prefer different times of the day to ride bikes but if one is aware of the most common and least common times they can choose the time they wish to ride. If a person is hoping to find rider buddies along their ride they can choose the most common times and if a person is hoping to easily find a bike they can choose the least common time. The optimum temperature is warm, not hot or cold.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Frequency of riders based on time of day\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the data we have, shown in Figure 2 surprisingly, afternoon is the most common time that riders choose even though it is commonly hot and sunny!"
