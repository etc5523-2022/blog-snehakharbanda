Hello everyone!

This blog was created by me, Sneha Kharbanda under the guidance of my professors Emi Tanaka and Weihao (Patrick) Li. I am currently pursuing my masters in Business Analytics from Monash University. I have completed my bachelors in Electrical and Electronics Engineering. I am hoping to change the world one code at a time. 

In my free time, I love to go out and explore new places and meet new people. On some days, I love staying home and painting.

If you have any feedback or issues feel free to reach out to me via skha0095@student.monash.edu !
